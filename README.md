## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

## Functionality

This version of the Udacity Memory Game project has been created by Brianne Hennel. Reference sources include: Memory Game Webinar with Mike Wales, Memory Game Webinar with Ryan Waite, Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Support Facebook Group, Stack Overflow, W3Schools, and MDN.

The purpose of the Memory Game is to match eight pairs of cards by clicking on them two at a time. The game is won when all eight pairs are matched. The number of moves a player makes and how long the game has been going on in seconds are displayed on the page. Players start with a five-star rating and stars are removed based on the number of moves it takes to win the game. Clicking on two cards is a move. Winners are given a final star rating, the number of moves it took to win, how many seconds it took to win, and the option to play again.

Gameplay: Click on a card to begin the game. Click on a second card to see if there is a match. If there is a match, the cards remain open. If there is not a match, the cards flip back over. Cards are clicked and matched until all eight pairs have been successfully matched.

Start over: To start a new game, click on the refresh button. Players are also given the option to start a new game after they win.
